# PasswordGene
Password generator that allows modification of output
We can modify our outcomes by setting each attribute to False. That is:
In the terminal type:
    "lowercase" in order to NOT have lowercase letters in your password
    "uppercase" in order to NOT have uppercase letters in your password
    "digits" in order to NOT have numbers in your password
    "punctuation" in order to NOT have symbols in your password
